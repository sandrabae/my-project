# my-project

This project was for me to use any API of my choice and use AngularJS to create a lightweight stream of activities.

So for this project I have chosen to use OpenWeatherMap API. 

There are two main features on this web-app:

1. There is a search button where you are able to search any city's current forecast. However this will only show in the 
first panel at the bottom.

2. There is a random city generator button as shown in the bottom right corner of the page. When you click on this button
a new city will be added to the top of the stream. As of right now, the random city generator is limited to 14 searches, but I
plan on adding more in the future.
