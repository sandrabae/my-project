#### Note: Fix in latest update (v 0.1.6) on October 30, 2015
Fixed bug leading to broken openweathermap API calls: Header field `x-api-key`
is not sufficient anymore, so that now an additional query parameter `APPID` is mandatory.

# angular-openweather-app â€” a weather forecast app written in AngularJS

<img src="app/img/app_screenshot_v_0-1-4_1.png" alt="OpenWeather App"/>

"OpenWeather App" is a small AngularJS project that makes use of the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/)
service for fetching and displaying weather data and forecasts based on a given location (city).

_This project basically serves as an example app I refer to within an article about AngularJS
I wrote for the German web technology magazine [t3n no. 34](http://t3n.de/news/t3n-34-fertig-100-wichtigsten-netzkoepfe-508528/)._


## Demo

A demo site running this little app can be found [here](http://w4.matthiaslienau.de/angular-openweather-app/app/).


## Why?

Points of interests:

* Building an app with AngularJS (of course!)
* Building an app based on the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/API/)
* Bootstrapping an AngularJS app: Basic modules and view definition, ng-app, ng-view
* Defining a controller for handling the weather data in $scope
* Defining a service for fetching weather data from openweathermap.com via JSONP
* Defining a custom directive for instantly embedding sort of "weather data day panel"
* Setting up unit and e2e-tests with karma/jasmine

angular-openweather-app uses:

* [AngularJS v1.2.0-rc.2](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) / [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)
* [iso-3166-country-codes-angular](https://github.com/BluePyth/iso-3166-country-codes-angular)
* [Bootstrap v3.0.0](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)


## Installation

### Clone repository and install dependencies

via git and npm:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:atufkas/angular-openweather-app.git [my-app-name]
$ cd [my-app-name]
$ npm install
```

### Run application via server

(see also [angular-seed docs](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed))

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with a webserver of-your-choice
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.


## Contribute!

Ideas, suggestions and pull requests are welcome. Someone willing to suggest a fancy (responsive) design
for desktop and mobile use?


## Todo

* Make use (and parse) more provided weather data (+ add filters, formatting)
* Internationalization / Localization
* Provide "use current location" and fetch data via lat/lon
* Build a view with n-day-forecast in typical weather app style
* Improve UI/UX by integrating a fancy design, transitions, effects
